# Twitter bot

This is an experiment of a twitter bot made with golang. It's based on the work of the great [clementb](https://github.com/clementb) and made with love.

The bot should do mainly 4 things :

- Tweet about defined topics
- Favorite tweets that are related to those topics
- Follow people that are tweeting about those topics
- Reply nicely to mentions

Right now, the bot is running on a test account, maybe you already follow him and you don't even know ;)
